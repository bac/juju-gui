    Implement the ACL object interface that can be used to check permissions
    and the ability to manipulate the connected Juju model and controller.

    Note that the controller access is described by the following values:
    - "login": users can log into the controller and only list the models they
      own;
    - "add-model": users can add models;
    - "superuser": users can do everything they want with the controller,
      including listing/removing all models owned by any users.
    The model access holds the following values:
    - "read": users can only access the model in read-only mode;
    - "write": users can modify the model but not delete or share it;
    - "admin": users can modify the model, including deleting and sharing it
      with someone else.
